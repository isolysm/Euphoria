Fix the build.gradle.kts file so you can properly build with it.
Add artifactoring to the project.
Replace Architectury with Remap-loom, which is currently not finished yet/still making.
Add a processor.kts file soon that should remap to the specified version of the game. 
Add version support within one jar (I know this will cause some amounts of bloat but idc.)
