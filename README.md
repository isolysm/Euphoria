# Euphoria
Euphoria is a simple and easy mod designed around the ease of use, as well as the versatility of the customization. It is stupid easy to configure this mod.

## Stuff we use

* [Blossom](https://github.com/isolysm/blossom) is the GUI we use.
* riBBon is the auto-updater task for the mod (This is closed source as of March 21st.)
* Preprocessor is used to develop Minecraft versions 1.8.9, 1.12.2, and 1.18.x. 
  * However, we do not provide 1.8.9 and 1.12.2. We will only work on it if we want to kill some time, and either way, you can find our features in other mods.

## Download
You can download Euphoria from the following locations:

* PlaceHolder (Serenity will be placed here once we finish.)
