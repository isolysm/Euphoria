# Euphoria
Euphoria is a dependency mod specifically made for all Myosyn LLC/Ulypse Modifications. The main point of this dependency mod was to provide privacy and other features 
that aren't present in other mods. We primarily rely on Essential, but might change it accordingly based on time.

This can just be a standalone mod, but I digress.

Euphoria is not meant for outside usage. We won't give instructions on how to include this dependency mod. Although we want this to be open source, just don't skid anything because you won't understand what you're doing. 


# Stuff we use

* [Blossom](https://github.com/ulypse/blossom) is the GUI we use.
* riBBon is the auto-updater task for the mod (This is closed source as of March 21st.)

# How to compile
No.

There are a couple of reasons why we don't include how to compile here, but to keep it short, someone can use it as a token logger.
