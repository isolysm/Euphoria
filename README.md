# Euphoria
Euphoria is a dependency mod specifically made for all Myosyn LLC/Ulypse Modifications. The main point of this dependency mod was to provide privacy and other features 
that aren't present in other mods. 

Euphoria is not meant for outside usage. We won't give instructions on how to include this dependency mod inside of a modification, which is why we've given the mod the ARR license, where all rights are reserved for us. Although we want this to be open source, just don't skid anything because you won't understand what you're doing.
