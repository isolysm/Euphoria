# Euphoria
Euphoria is a simple and easy mod designed around the ease of use, as well as the versatility of the customization. It is stupid easy to configure this mod.

## Development on Euphoria
Hey, this is Vispin, an active developer on Euphoria. 

We're sorry to say this is taking longer than expected, but please be aware we're a two person group that has projects and assignments in real life to complete.
Our goals are also a lot more ambitious than you think, resulting in us trying to improve our features, as well as try to make it so it is unmatched by other mods. 

Whatever the case is, we hope that this project releases soon, and by soon, I mean before 2023.

## Stuff we use

* [Blossom](https://github.com/isolysm/blossom) is the GUI we use.
* riBBon is the auto-updater task for the mod (This is closed source as of March 21st.)
* Preprocessor is used to develop Minecraft versions 1.8.9, 1.12.2, and 1.18.x. 
  * However, we do not provide 1.8.9 and 1.12.2. We will only work on it if we want to kill some time, and either way, you can find our features in other mods.
  * 1.8.9 and 1.12.2 intentionally have LESS features due to mods conflicting with them.
  * 1.8.9 will also have features that might BREAK your game. We highly advise you to not use that version. 

## Download
You can download Euphoria from the following locations:
