# Euphoria
Euphoria is a simple and easy mod designed around the ease of use, as well as the versatility of the customization. It is stupid easy to configure this mod.

This is a FABRIC mod. Please do not add this to Forge, as you will crash, regardless of circumstance.

## Stuff we use

* ~~[Blossom](https://github.com/isolysm/blossom) is the GUI we use.~~ Not implemented yet
* ~~riBBon is the auto-updater task for the mod (This is closed source as of March 21st.)~~ Not implemented yet.
* Preprocessor is used to develop Minecraft versions 1.8.9, 1.12.2, and 1.18.x. 
  * However, we do not provide 1.8.9 and 1.12.2. We will only work on it if we want to kill some time, and either way, you can find our features in other mods.
  * 1.8.9 and 1.12.2 intentionally have LESS features due to mods conflicting with them.
  * 1.8.9 will also have features that might BREAK your game. We highly advise you to not use that version.
